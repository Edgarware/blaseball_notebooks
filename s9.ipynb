    "* Solar Eclipses cause Incinerations.\n",
    "* Peanuts cause yummy/allergic peanut reactions (±20% to all stats) as well as giant falling peanuts that can shell players mid-game.\n",
    "* Birds cause batters to occasionally ~~get out in the middle of their at-bat~~ (removed due to bugs), and is the only known way to break Shelled players free.\n",
    "* Feedback causes players to swap teams.\n",
    "* Reverb can either shuffle the lineup, rotation, or whole team order. It can also cause a player to become Reverberating, which permanently gives them a chance to bat twice in a row.\n",
    "* Blooddrain causes players to drain a specific stat (10%) from a player on the other team.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Decrees will pass at the end of the election. It is unknown how these decrees will affect the weather but it is believed that the 3 chosen weathers will be the only weathers available for the next season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Birds is an obvious benefit for us due to our Affinity for Crows (50% better batting/pitching for the Pies) and is generally supported by teams that need to break players out of shells. Teams tend to dislike Feedback and Solar Eclipses as it can kill or trade players they like. Strategically, Peanuts is the worst as it causes a player to lose on average 1 star in each category OR completely remove them from games until they are unshelled."
